    <h1>About this page</h1>

    <p>
        This website tries to visualize the current state of the HHVM support in PHP libraries and frameworks.
        <br/>
        Aim is to provide a resource to check, if used libraries support HHVM.
    </p>

    <p>
        To provide this information, we list all available packages from packagist.org and try to fetch the .travis.yml file from github for all listed versions.
        The result of this can be as followed:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="label label-danger"><b>Not Supported</b></span>: The package is a "language: php" travis build, but does not build against HHVM at all.</li>
            <li><span class="label label-warning"><b>Allowed Failure</b></span>: The package lists HHVM as a build, but failures for HHVM are allowed.</li>
            <li><span class="label label-success"><b>Supported</b></span>: The package has 'hhvm' listed under 'php' and it is <b>not</b> a allowed failure.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-default"><b>Unknown</b></span>: The package does not fit to any of the previous specifications.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        For every version of a package, this information was fetched and stored in a database. For the "dev" versions,
        the information will be updated if a newer commit reference is found.
    </p>

    <p>
        The progress bar on the frontpage is showing a package as green, when at least <b>one</b> version/branch is supporting HHVM.
        This is equal to orange, if the package supports HHVM at least as a allowed failure.
        Any package that is red, does not build against HHVM at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Projects, that do not have a .travis.yml file, or that are not configured as "language: php", will be ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
        This site should not be used to provide some sort of pressure on packages not supporting HHVM.
        If you want to have HHVM support in a package, talk to the maintainers or try to provide it yourself, it ain't that hard!
    </p>
